DATA SCIENCE & ANALYTICS



- Data Analysis of Student Feedback: Loaded and cleaned student feedback data from a CSV file.
- Sentiment Analysis: Applied VADER sentiment analysis to quantify student sentiment for each feedback question.
- Trend Identification: Analyzed sentiment scores to identify overall satisfaction and trends across courses. Highlighted questions with the highest and lowest sentiment.
- Theme Extraction: Used NLP (TF-IDF and K-Means clustering) to group similar feedback questions and identify key thematic areas.
- Visualization: Created charts to visualize sentiment by theme clusters and the range of sentiment across questions.
- Actionable Recommendations: Provided insights and recommendations for improvement based on areas with lower sentiment (e.g., evaluation, syllabus, communication) and areas of strength (e.g., internships, teacher support).

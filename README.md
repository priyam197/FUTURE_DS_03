Project: Student Feedback Sentiment Analysis
This project analyzes student satisfaction survey data using Python (Pandas, NLTK, Seaborn) to uncover trends in feedback, identify strengths and weaknesses in teaching, and generate actionable insights.

 What I Did:
- Cleaned and processed survey data from a .csv file

- Extracted and converted percentage scores from text to numeric

- Applied sentiment analysis using VADER to evaluate student feedback

- Grouped feedback by course, question, and cluster to explore patterns

- Used TF-IDF and KMeans clustering to uncover thematic topics

- Created visualizations for sentiment distribution and low/high scoring questions

 Key Insights:
- Overall sentiment score across all responses was moderately positive

- Feedback about internships, mentoring, and extracurriculars received the highest sentiment

- Internal evaluation fairness, syllabus coverage, and use of ICT tools had lower sentiment, suggesting areas for improvement

 Skills Applied:
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

- Sentiment Analysis (NLTK VADER)

- Unsupervised Clustering (KMeans)

- Text Preprocessing and Feature Extraction (TF-IDF)

- Data Visualization (Seaborn & Matplotlib)

Files:
- Student_Satisfaction_Survey.csv – Raw survey dataset

- student_feedback_2.ipynb – Main analysis notebook

- student_feedback 2.pdf – Rendered output (report view)
